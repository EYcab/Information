# Release summary

The current version is 0.0.7. Previous version was 0.0.6.

Differences between the two versions:

- Fixed issues with vignettes

# Test environments

* Local OS X install, R 3.1.2 and R 3.2.2, using devtools::check()

* win-builder (devel and release).

# R CMD check results

I got the NOTE: "File README.md cannot be checked without ‘pandoc’ being installed." I can't get rid of this unless I add the README.md file to .Rbuildignore, which does not seems like a good strategy. So I am ignorig this for now, hoping that the CRAN servers will have pandoc.
