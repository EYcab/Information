\title{Data exploration with information theory (weight-of-evidence and information value)}
\description{
The information package is designed to perform exploratory data analysis and variable screening for binary
classification models using WOE and IV. The package also supports exploratory analysis and variable screening
for uplift models (NWOE and NIV).

Note that the only functions you will need to call are create_infotables(), SinglePlot() and MultiPlot()
create_infotables() creates WOE/NWOE tables (accessed by Tables$<variable name>)
and outputs a data.frame that contains IV or NIV for all variables.
IV and NIV values are found in the Summary data.frame.

SinglePlot() plots the WOE vector for a sigle variable

MultiPlot() plots WOE vectors for multiple variables on a single page. Multiple pages will be created
if needed (9 plots per page).
}
\details{
Given a data.frame with a set of predictive variables and
a binary response variable, Information::create_infotables() will cycle through all variables and create
NWOE or WOE tables. It will also rank all variables by their respective NIV/IV values.

Calculations will be distributed across multiple cores.

NWOE analysis is only for uplift models. Thus, for NWOE analysis, you must have a "treatment" and a conrol group identified by a binary treatment indicator.
For regular WOE analysis, all you need is a binary response variable (dependent variable).

You can cross validate your IV or NIV values by supplying a validation dataset. This will produce penalized IV/NIV values.

# Plotting a single variable
Information::plot_infotables(IV, "N_OPEN_REV_ACTS")
